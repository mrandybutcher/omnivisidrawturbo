# Tech Debt
* [x] Refactor the Selection/Pen tool stuff out Canvas
* [x] Sort out all the floating-point geometry
* [x] Stop Canvas re-rendering so much (useCallback wrap param passed to useDrag?)
* [x] Move the colours into a SCSS file
* [x] Prevent all elements re-rendering when one is moved
* [ ] Combine selection scale/transform to single transform that is all box based
* [ ] Write some Tests
* [ ] Use reselect for more component selectors to speed things up
* [ ] Abstract mousedown to detect clicks and ready for touch support
* [ ] Replace random id generation with proper uuid's
* [ ] Dig into performance a bit once reselect done
* [ ] Less OMG UI

# Deployment
* [ ] Setup CI
* [x] Setup r3b.dev custom domain
* [x] Deploy to firebase hosting
* [x] Refactor store so selection is separate to diagram elements
* [x] Refactor store so selectionDragBox is separate to selection
* [x] Refactor selectionState so it is part of selectionReducer
